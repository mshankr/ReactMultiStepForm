#react-hooks-helper TypeScript Multi-step Form

[Live demo](https://mshankr.github.io/ReactMultiStepForm)

## Technology

- TypeScript
- [react-hooks-helper](https://github.com/revelcw/react-hooks-helper): useStep, useForm

## Styling

- Semantic UI (Just the min.css)
- Tachyons (Just the min.css)

## Challenges

I personally think this is the simplest and most useful React Hooks helper library. Type defintions @types/react-hooks-helper are not entirely correct. Will have to submit PR for that. Mangled type defs to get the form library to work.

[Original code](https://codesandbox.io/s/simple-multi-step-form-in-react-2h3ki) here with JS (no Typescript).
I practised re-creating a TypeScript version of it.
